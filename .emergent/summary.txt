The AI engineer successfully built a frontend-only e-commerce application named NEXX, cloning aossparts.ru's structure with a dark premium design. Initial work involved extensive file generation for various pages and components using mock data. After addressing a minor bug with catalog filters (specifically, the price slider), the core frontend functionality was confirmed via . The most recent task involves implementing a new feature: supplier integration via API, similar to abcp.ru, for real-time stock and delivery updates. The engineer has started by creating new admin components for supplier management and updating  and  to accommodate this new functionality. The work on supplier integration is currently in progress.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a fully functional e-commerce store, NEXX, based on , featuring a dark, premium, minimalist, and modern design that looks more expensive and solid. Key functionalities include:
-   **Core E-commerce**: Product catalog, search, filters, shopping cart, user account, order placement and payment, delivery.
-   **Admin Panel**: Comprehensive management for products, orders, users, analytics, and site settings (images, colors, data) without code.
-   **Authentication**: Registration/login via email/password or Russian phone number (+7 standard).
-   **Products**: Identical to , focusing on JCB tractor spare parts.
-   **Technical**: Optimized, fast, adaptive, SEO-friendly.
-   **Deployment**: Out-of-the-box launchable.
-   **Payment Integration**: Can be added later.
-   **New Feature (Post-MVP)**: Integration with suppliers via API (like ) to display real-time stock and delivery times directly in the store.

So far, a complete frontend with mocked data for all core e-commerce functionalities (catalog, product pages, cart, checkout, auth, admin dashboard) has been implemented and visually verified. The admin panel includes placeholder sections for products, orders, users, analytics, and settings. The product data mimics JCB tractor spare parts. The current focus is on integrating the supplier management system.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the full implementation of the supplier integration feature, including:
    -   Backend API endpoints for managing suppliers.
    -   Backend logic for integrating with external supplier APIs (mocking this first if no real API is provided).
    -   Connecting frontend supplier management components (, , ) to the backend.
    -   Updating  to fetch and display actual supplier offers and stock/delivery information.
-   Backend development for all core e-commerce functionalities (catalog, search, cart, user accounts, orders, admin features) as outlined in .
-   Replacing all frontend mock data with actual data fetched from the backend.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing the supplier integration feature, which aims to allow the store to connect to external supplier APIs for real-time stock and delivery information, similar to .

The initial steps for this feature have been completed on the frontend:
1.  **Creation of new admin components**:
    *   
    *   
    *   
    These components are intended to manage supplier information and integration settings within the admin panel.
2.  **Update to **: The file  has been edited. This edit is crucial for displaying supplier-specific stock, delivery times, and pricing on individual product pages, fulfilling the user's request. The exact code changes are not provided in the trajectory, but the edit was successful.
3.  **Update to **: The file  has been edited. This update is to integrate the newly created supplier management components into the main admin panel navigation or dashboard, making them accessible to the administrator. The exact changes are not provided, but the edit was successful.

The work paused after the user prompted Дальше following the  update.
