The AI engineer's work involved a complex and iterative development of the NEXX e-commerce store, originally a React/FastAPI/MongoDB application. Recurring user feedback highlighted the application's demo nature and deployment difficulties on their VPS. This led to multiple architectural shifts, including a file-based JSON backend and a brief, unsuccessful attempt at a pure HTML/JS frontend. Core efforts focused on implementing extensive admin features, various integrations (payment, suppliers, 1C), and SMS authentication, often requiring detailed manual deployment and troubleshooting instructions for the user. Persistent issues, particularly with API connectivity () and non-functional admin components, characterized the later stages. The user's most recent, comprehensive request (Chat 169) reinforced the need for a robust, fully integrated admin panel, working SMS login, and complete site customization, while explicitly preserving the existing React frontend. The trajectory concluded with the AI engineer attempting to recreate existing backend files, indicating a potential misstep in modification strategy.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a fully functional, production-ready NEXX e-commerce store, inspired by , with a dark, premium design. Initial features included a product catalog, search, filters, shopping cart, user accounts, order placement, admin panel (products, orders, users, analytics, settings), and authentication (email/password or Russian phone). Post-MVP, supplier integration via API (e.g., ) was added for real-time stock/delivery.

The user explicitly evolved these needs into a fully ready internet store with:
1.  **Admin-managed Integrations**: Configure supplier APIs (e.g., ABCP.ru, Exist.ru), Russian payment systems (YooMoney, Sberbank, QIWI, Tinkoff, CloudPayments), and delivery methods.
2.  **Comprehensive Admin Panel**: Dashboard with sales analytics and order management; user/staff management (CRUD, roles, legal/retail profiles); site configuration (company data, contact info, images, logo, themes, button layouts); content management (creating, editing, deleting pages, news, uploading media); and advanced SEO settings.
3.  **User Accounts**: Registration/login for legal/retail entities, including SMS-based login (verification codes), and a personal cabinet (order history, profile management).
4.  **1C Integration**: Settings for connection, synchronization of products/prices, and order transfer.
5.  **Robustness**: All functions must work clearly without problems, from the first time.

-   , , , : These React files were previously modified/created to build the React-based admin panel.
-   , , : These files were directly overwritten on the user's server with raw HTML/JS content multiple times, for both the main site and the admin panel, as quick fixes and feature tests. This often resulted in breaking the original React functionality, which the user subsequently requested to restore. The last successful state involved the original React frontend and a minimal HTML/JS admin page, followed by an attempt at a full HTML/JS admin, which led to conflicts.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing the user's most recent, comprehensive request (Chat Message 169) for a fully functional and sophisticated admin panel, robust backend integrations, and working SMS login, while *preserving the existing React frontend design*.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer had attempted to implement SMS authentication and backend service placeholders. This involved:
1.  Creating  and  in .
2.  Attempting to extend  and  with new functionality.
3.  Updating  with , , .

However, the previous attempts to directly modify  and  in the  directory with plain HTML/JS had broken the original React frontend and resulted in a simplified, non-functional admin panel. The user explicitly stated, все что ты делаешь не помогает, админку урезал, and СМС вход так и не налажен (Chat 169). The user also indicated an API 502 Bad Gateway error when trying to access  (Chat 131), though later reported  and  were working after some fixes (Chat 165).

The very last action in the trajectory shows the AI engineer trying to Создаю полный Backend API с всеми интеграциями (Chat 174), and then immediately failing to   because the file already exists (Chat 175). This indicates a critical point where the AI engineer needs to carefully *modify* existing files rather than attempting to recreate them, and ensure the local changes are reflected on the user's server.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Correctly modify the existing  and  to implement the comprehensive admin features, SMS authentication, and all requested integrations, then update the React frontend to correctly interact with these new backend functionalities, as per the user's explicit request.
