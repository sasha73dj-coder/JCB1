<analysis>
The AI engineer's work evolved through several iterations in response to the user's persistent dissatisfaction with the demo nature of the application. Initially, the engineer successfully implemented a frontend-only e-commerce store, NEXX, mirroring  with mock data. The first major feature, supplier integration, was built with a FastAPI backend and React frontend, including CRUD operations, but faced challenges with ID mismatches and backend deployment issues on the user's server.

After repeated complaints about the lack of a ready-to-launch store, the engineer successively attempted to address the problem by shifting from mock data to a full API backend (MongoDB), then to a -based frontend-only solution, and finally to a file-based backend to achieve autonomy. Each attempt aimed to provide a turnkey solution but continuously failed due to underlying environment/deployment issues on the user's side, leading to an incomplete or non-functional state on the user's server. The user then provided a comprehensive, CRM-like feature list. The AI engineer has just started building a pure HTML/CSS/JS full_store structure.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a fully functional e-commerce store, NEXX, inspired by , featuring a dark, premium design. Key functionalities include a product catalog, search, filters, shopping cart, user account, order placement, admin panel (products, orders, users, analytics, settings), authentication (email/password or Russian phone), and optimization for speed and SEO. A post-MVP feature was supplier integration via API (like ) for real-time stock and delivery.

The application has evolved to meet these demands. After the initial frontend with mock data, supplier integration was implemented with a FastAPI backend. However, user feedback highlighted that the store remained a demo, lacking real backend functionality and proper deployment. The user explicitly requested a fully ready internet store with:
1.  **Admin-managed integrations**: Ability to add supplier APIs, API keys, payment systems, and delivery methods via the admin panel.
2.  **Comprehensive Admin Panel**: Dashboard (current/completed orders, sales sum), user management (add/edit/delete, profiles for legal/retail entities), staff management (roles/permissions).
3.  **User Accounts**: Registration/login for legal/retail entities, personal cabinet (order history, current orders, personal data, account, legal/retail profiles).
4.  **Site Configuration**: Admin control for company data, requisites, contact info, page management, button layout, images, carousels, logo, themes, and SEO information.

<code_architecture>
The application started as a React frontend with a FastAPI/MongoDB backend. Due to deployment issues, it temporarily shifted to a -only frontend, and then to a FastAPI backend using a file-based JSON database. The most recent action is creating a new, completely standalone HTML/JS structure.



**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : The central backend logic file. It was initially set up for MongoDB, then heavily modified to handle API endpoints for supplier management (CRUD for suppliers, offers, test connection), and later completely rewritten to use a file-based JSON database for all core e-commerce entities (users, products, carts, orders, integrations, settings).
-   : A newly created file implementing a simple file-based JSON database for persistence, replacing MongoDB. This was an attempt to simplify deployment.
-   : The authentication page. It was rewritten multiple times to integrate with the backend API, then , and finally the file-based backend API for user login/registration.
-   : The shopping cart page. It was completely refactored to interact with various backend iterations (MongoDB, then file-based) and also  for adding/removing items and calculating totals.
-   : Displays individual product details. Modified to show supplier offers and integrate Add to Cart functionality, adapting to  and the file-based backend.
-   : The admin panel for product management. Heavily refactored to perform CRUD operations against the backend (initially mock, then API, then , then file-based) and includes a form for product creation/editing.
-   , , : New components created to manage supplier integration details within the admin panel, fetching and displaying supplier data.
-   : Initially provided all data. Updated to use UUIDs for product IDs to match backend UUIDs, but later largely bypassed by direct API/localStorage interactions.
-   : Created to provide authentication state and functions globally across the frontend when  was used for autonomy.
-   : Created to encapsulate  interactions for the autonomous store attempt.
-   : A new directory created for the latest attempt, intending to build a fully standalone, CRM-like application directly in HTML/JS. , ,  have been created here.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the implementation of the comprehensive CRM-like internet store with a pure HTML/CSS/JS frontend (no backend).
-   Implement full authentication (login/registration for legal/retail users).
-   Develop the personal cabinet (order history, current orders, profile management, account details, legal/retail profiles).
-   Build the complete admin panel (dashboard, user management, staff management, permissions, supplier API integration, payment services, delivery settings, and extensive site configurations).

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing a completely autonomous store that fulfills the user's latest and most comprehensive request for a turnkey CRM-like e-commerce system. This is the fifth major iteration of addressing the user's core problem of a non-functional or demo-like store.

The current approach involves building a pure HTML/CSS/JS application without a separate backend, aiming for maximum autonomy and ease of deployment on the user's server without requiring specific backend configurations. The engineer has started by:
1.  **Creating a new project directory**: .
2.  **Initializing core files**:
    *   : The main entry point for the standalone application.
    *   : Likely intended to hold embedded product/store data.
    *   : Intended to handle client-side authentication logic.

The engineer explicitly stated, Продолжаю! Создаю систему аутентификации: and then Создаю систему администрирования:, indicating work on the authentication and administration modules within this new pure-frontend architecture. This represents a significant pivot from previous attempts involving FastAPI backends (MongoDB or file-based) and React.
